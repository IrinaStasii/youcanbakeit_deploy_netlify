Comprising layers of soft sponge cake, rich whipped cream, and often adorned with chocolate pieces, the Cu»ôma lui Gugu»õƒÉ cake resembles a whimsical hat. The layers are carefully stacked to create a distinct cone shape, and the exterior is intricately decorated to mimic the hat made from sheep wool worn by the beloved character. This cake not only captivates with its playful design but also delights the taste buds with its combination of textures and flavors, making it a cherished treat for special occasions and celebrations in Moldovian culture.",

    instructions1:
      "Mix the butter + sour cream + flour to form a dough. Combine the baking soda with vinegar and wait for 10-20 seconds (foam will form). Add it to the dough and knead a bit until well combined. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and leave it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Drain the sour cherries well. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and divide it into 4 equal pieces. Take one piece of dough at a time and roll it into a rectangular shape with a rolling pin. Cut it into 4 pieces (strips). Fill each strip of dough with sour cherries and place it on a baking sheet with parchment paper, leaving space between them. I baked 8 rolls/sheet (one sheet in the oven) at 180‚Å∞C for 35 minutes, without ventilation. You'll get a total of 16 rolls. Use 15 for the cake. ",

Leave the cake in the refrigerator for a minimum of 10 hours or, preferably, overnight. The cake can also be made with pancakes if you don't have enough time or want to make it quickly, but the taste cannot be compared. üòä The next day, I decorated the cake with grated chocolate. This is the specific decoration of this cake that represents Guguta's hat.",

If melting over a double boiler, ensure that the water does not touch the bowl (they melt from the steam). When the water starts to boil, place the bowl over the steam and continuously stir until the mixture is homogeneous. 2.Heat the cream on low heat and when it's close to the boiling point (be careful not to let it boil), remove it from the heat and pour it over the chocolate in the bowl, making sure the cream covers the chocolate. Let it sit for 1 minute without stirring, then mix until the mixture becomes homogeneous. Cover the bowl with parchment paper and place it in the refrigerator for 3-6 hours (depending on the chocolate, the mixture will harden more quickly or slowly). When you feel the mixture is solid enough but not too firm (enough to allow you to form chocolate balls), take it out of the refrigerator and shape it into truffles. Roll the formed truffles in cocoa powder.",
